#################################### KNOWN PROBLEMS IN YARDSALE ####################################

CREATE ACCOUNT: button locks after a failed account creation (due to bad email or passwords).
[CreateAccountActivity.java | line 76] 
  -> bad placement of 'btn.setEnabled(false)' for preventing double account creation.

  
CREATE ACCOUNT: bad zipcode (not 5 integers) is still accepted and stored despite warning.
[AccountUtil.java | line 101] 
  -> always returning true even if zipcode is not 5 integers.

  
ACCOUNT SETTINGS: email shouldn't be editable and if changed, results in "Update Failed".
[AccountSettingsActivity.java | line 151]
  -> issue with 'private void updateUserSettings(String email, String password, String postalCode)'.
  
  
ACCOUNT SETTINGS: bad zipcode (not 5 integers) is still accepted and updated despite warning.
[AccountUtil.java | line 101] 
  -> always returning true even if zipcode is not 5 integers.

  
ACCOUNT SETTINGS: bad password (no regex match) is still accepted and updated despite warning.
[AccountSettingsActivity.java | line ?]
  -> ?
 
 
ACCOUNT SETTINGS: empty field forces app to restart, especially password which is left blank.
[AccountSettingsActivity.java | line 151]
  -> cannot call 'private void updateUserSettings(String email, String password, String postalCode)'
     on empty/null String.
  
  
ACCOUNT SETTINGS: changing account zipcode doesn't update already uploaded posts.
[AccountSettingsActivity.java | line 151]
  -> 'private void updateUserSettings(String email, String password, String postalCode)' doesn't 
     include function to edit database posts.
 
 
CREATE POST: adding a picture before typing the post description causes input text to be visually 
             blocked by the keyboard. 
[activity_create_post.xml | line 2]
  -> need to add a vertically scrollable layout as parent

  
CREATE POST: bad zipcode (not 5 integers) is still accepted and uploaded.
[CreatePostActivity.java | line 178] 
  -> zipcode not validated, only existance required.
 
 
SEARCH: search reads multiple keywords separated by spaces as a single sentence string.
[Navigation.java | line 134] 
  -> need to parse query into substrings, and add aPost containing any of the substrings to the list
     of posts for the interface adapter.
