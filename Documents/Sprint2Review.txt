Team Name: YardSale Team
Product Name: YardSale

Actions to Stop Doing:
- The team should stop talking out of turn during Scrum meetings as it makes the meetings longer and less effective.
- The team should make sure everyone can come the meeting on the schedule meeting time.

Actions to Start Doing:
- The team should push work more often into github as hoarding code makes integration less viable between units.
- The team should have reply ASAP on the slack in order to check the progress of the meeting.

Actions to Keep Doing:
- The team should keep up the great communication as it helps keep everyone up-to-date on current matters and tasks.
