SPRINT 1 REVIEW

Team Name: YardSale Team
Product Name: YardSale

Actions to Stop Doing:
- The team should stop talking out of turn during Scrum meetings as it makes the meetings longer and less effective.
- The team should stop gettings sick as it makes meetings less effective as not everybody's there.

Actions to Start Doing:
- The team should push work more often into github as hoarding code makes integration less viable between units.

Actions to Keep Doing:
- The team should keep up the great communication as it helps keep everyone up-to-date on current matters and tasks.
